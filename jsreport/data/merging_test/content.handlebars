This should never have some utils in used. 

The execution should append 1 or 2 reports based on script function.

Set the function isTrue() on the script util_switch to return true or false to change the number of reports appended.

If i've renderer this template once and then refresh jsreport studio, I found in pdf utils the list of last reports. (this not happen in playground)
